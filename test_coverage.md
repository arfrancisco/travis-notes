Test Coverage and Code Quality
======

Travis-CI alone is only helpful IF you have tests. If you don't have tests then Travis-CI will always pass your build. 
Essentially we can always cheat ourselves into always having a passing build as long as we don't test.

The solution. Integrate it with Code Climate. 

Travis-CI already runs our tests and checks our coverage. We just a way to interpret that.
